# Discussion about metrics

To ensure the success of our project, it's essential to choose the most appropriate metrics. Therefore, we will compile a list of the most commonly used and effective metrics. By comparing metrics based on their relevance to our project, we can identify the best-suited ones that will provide the most meaningful insights and guide us towards achieving our goals.

### 1. Constraints

In order to accurately develop our model, it's important to consider the various constraints involved. These include:

- Multi-class classification, with three classes
- Class imbalance, with one class having significantly more instances than the others
- A small dataset with only a few records
- Medical classification, with a specific emphasis on identifying most cases of pneumonia (whether viral or bacterial) with a high degree of confidence.

By taking these constraints into account, we can ensure that our model is optimized for the specific requirements of the task at hand, and can effectively detect cases of pneumonia.

### 2. Metrics

First metrics are based on the confusion matrix,

So, here is a short description of metrics :
